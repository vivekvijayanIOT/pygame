Algorithm for planet.py:
--------------------------------------------------
1.start the program.
2.import all the required py-packages.
3.initiate the pygame class and set the pygame display size.
4.load the images of sun,moon,earth into a variable, if images are not available just initialise a color upon a variable.
5.Create a random stars within the display size and Set the Screen background as black.
6.Now for every event in pygame, move the location of each variables(Earth,Moon) based on a mathematical formula.
7.using blit function, record the every changes of each objects position on the screen.
8.Finally set the clocking speed of this pygame.
9.end.




Algorithm for Ball bouncing:
--------------------------------------------------
1.start the program.
2.import all the required py-packages.
3.initiate the pygame class and set the pygame display size.
4.load the image of a ball to a variable.
5.set the gravityAcceleration (i.e. How fast the y-axis of the ball should get reduced).
6.Now using the key object of pygame to make a game interactive, Using K_LEFT, K_RIGHT, K_UP make change to the position of the ball.
7.Based on the gravityAcceleration, Onrelease of the key the ball must reach down.
8.using blit function, record the every changes of each objects position on the screen.
9.Finally set the clocking speed of this pygame.
10.end.
